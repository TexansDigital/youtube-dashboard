        "description": "Head Coach DeMeco Ryans joins All Access following the Houston Texans road win over the Los Angeles Chargers and the team officially clinching a playoff berth.\n\nRyans reflects on the journey from early season adversity to a team built on belief, accountability, and consistency. He breaks down how new players have stepped into key roles, how the Texans culture shows up every day inside the building, and why preparation and communication matter most in high pressure moments.\n\nThe conversation dives into the fast start against the Chargers, clutch offensive execution late in the game, disciplined tackling on defense, and the importance of winning on the road as the postseason approaches. Ryans also shares insight on player development, leadership, and how the Texans stay focused with multiple playoff scenarios still in play.\n\nWith the regular season finale ahead, the message remains clear. Control what you can control. Win the day.

        "description": "New Uniforms released on April 23! Learn more here: https://www.h-townmade.com/\n\nHouston Texans Chair and CEO Cal McNair charged his leadership team with finding ways for the organization to fearlessly evolve in fan-driven ways.  \n\nWe asked and the fans responded.  \n\nWhen it came to uniforms, they wanted a new, fresher look for their Houston Texans.  Through 10,000+ surveys, over 30+ focus groups with fans, local influencers, Texans Legends, current players, fan groups, and the guidance of a newly-formed fan council, McNair and the Texans heard a lot of feedback on possible new looks. With fan feedback in hand, they met with Nike and the NFL to map out how they could provide something for everyone with a new set of uniforms.  \n\nOn April 23, those uniforms will be released for the first time. \n\nHere is the full story behind how they were inspired by and created for H-Town. \n\nSubscribe: tex.nz/youtubesubscribe\n\nTickets: https://tex.nz/2024yt-seasons\n\nFollow Us!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/houstontexans/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/HoustonTexans/\nhttps://twitter.com/HoustonTexans\nhttps://www.HoustonTexans.com",
