Players, coaches, and staff all played a role in building the belief, discipline, and consistency that led to this moment. The message is clear. Show up every day. Trust the work. Take what you earn.\n\nThe speech also includes a special moment recognizing Nick Caserio for his leadership and tireless commitment to the team, highlighted on his birthday.\n\nThis is a team built on accountability, effort, and togetherness. The door is open. Now the focus turns to what comes next.\n\nSubscribe for more Texans locker room moments, postgame speeches, All Access content, and playoff\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/3UH7n0E\n\nTickets: https://www.houstontexans.com/tickets/",
