Stroud breaks down what made the matchup challenging, how the Texans adjusted after halftime, and why \u201cweathering the storm\u201d is part of winning in December football.\n\nStroud also gives major credit to the Texans defense for its relentless pressure on Justin Herbert, piling up sacks and creating a takeaway to swing momentum. With Houston continuing to build toward January, Stroud explains what makes this team equipped for a postseason run \u2014 pointing to the organizational foundation, physical style, and tough preparation led by Nick Casario and DeMeco Ryans.\n\nPlus, Stroud shares a brief \u201cwelcome home\u201d moment in Southern California and shouts out his roots after a big Texans win in LA.\n\nSubscribe for more Houston Texans postgame interviews, highlights, locker room coverage, and behind-the-scenes content all season long.\n\n#HoustonTexans #CJStroud #Texans #NFL #Chargers #Postgame #DeMecoRyans #NickCasario\n\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/3UH7n0E\n\nTickets: https://www.houstontexans.com/tickets/",

Players, coaches, and staff all played a role in building the belief, discipline, and consistency that led to this moment. The message is clear. Show up every day. Trust the work. Take what you earn.\n\nThe speech also includes a special moment recognizing Nick Caserio for his leadership and tireless commitment to the team, highlighted on his birthday.\n\nThis is a team built on accountability, effort, and togetherness. The door is open. Now the focus turns to what comes next.\n\nSubscribe for more Texans locker room moments, postgame speeches, All Access content, and playoff\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/3UH7n0E\n\nTickets: https://www.houstontexans.com/tickets/",
