Players, coaches, and staff all played a role in building the belief, discipline, and consistency that led to this moment. The message is clear. Show up every day. Trust the work. Take what you earn.\n\nThe speech also includes a special moment recognizing Nick Caserio for his leadership and tireless commitment to the team, highlighted on his birthday.\n\nThis is a team built on accountability, effort, and togetherness. The door is open. Now the focus turns to what comes next.\n\nSubscribe for more Texans locker room moments, postgame speeches, All Access content, and playoff\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/3UH7n0E\n\nTickets: https://www.houstontexans.com/tickets/",

After starting 0 and 3, this team refused to blink, responded to adversity, and surged into the NFL playoffs with a nine game win streak. Iron Sharpens Iron Episode 11 takes you inside the locker room, the turning points, and the mindset that defined one of the most resilient seasons in Texans history.\n\nFrom defining wins and clutch moments to leadership, belief, and culture, this episode shows how the Texans built momentum, trusted each other, and finished the regular season the right way. This is the story of a team built for January.\n\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/3UH7n0E\n\nTickets: https://www.houstontexans.com/tickets/",
