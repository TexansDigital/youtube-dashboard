Players, coaches, and staff all played a role in building the belief, discipline, and consistency that led to this moment. The message is clear. Show up every day. Trust the work. Take what you earn.\n\nThe speech also includes a special moment recognizing Nick Caserio for his leadership and tireless commitment to the team, highlighted on his birthday.\n\nThis is a team built on accountability, effort, and togetherness. The door is open. Now the focus turns to what comes next.\n\nSubscribe for more Texans locker room moments, postgame speeches, All Access content, and playoff\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/3UH7n0E\n\nTickets: https://www.houstontexans.com/tickets/",

This is the story of a team built for January.\n\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/3UH7n0E\n\nTickets: https://www.houstontexans.com/tickets/",

        "description": "Head Coach DeMeco Ryans addresses the team in the locker room after the Houston Texans earn a road win over the Los Angeles Chargers and clinch a playoff berth.\n\nFrom where this group started to where it stands now, Ryans credits every person in the building. Players, coaches, and staff all played a role in building the belief, discipline, and consistency that led to this moment. The message is clear. Show up every day. Trust the work. Take what you earn.\n\nThe speech also includes a special moment recognizing Nick Caserio for his leadership and tireless commitment to the team, highlighted on his birthday.\n\nThis is a team built on accountability, effort, and togetherness. The door is open. Now the focus turns to what comes next.\n\nSubscribe for more Texans locker room moments, postgame speeches, All Access content, and playoff\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/3UH7n0E\n\nTickets: https://www.houstontexans.com/tickets/",
